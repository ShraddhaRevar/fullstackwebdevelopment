This exercise is very similar to Exercise 01, but it should be completed using Express. To run this app: Go to the directory where the this folder(03-expres-routing) is present and open terminal in that folder. Restart your server for better usage. Then type : node 03-expres-routing.js and press enter. This command initiates the server at the port number 5000. So, go to the browser and start localhost by typing "http://localhost:5000" in the search bar. This will redirect you the app that is running on the server with portnumber 5000. Then you'll be seeing a welcome message for the landing route'/. After that if you enter different routes like '/cache' , '/cookie'... etc, each route will display it's own output which is written in its function in the JavaScript file.
